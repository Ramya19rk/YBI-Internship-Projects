# Data Science and Machine Learning Projects

I completed a 2-week Data Science and Machine Learning internship at YBI Foundation, where I developed and honed my skills through the following projects:

## Chance of Admission Prediction:

Algorithm: Linear Regression

Description: Predicted the chances of admission based on various factors.
## Cancer Prediction:

Algorithm: Logistic Regression

Accuracy: 95%

Description: Developed a model to predict cancer presence with high accuracy.

## Fish Weight Prediction:

Algorithm: Linear Regression

Description: Predicted the weight of fish based on species and other measurements.

## Customer Purchase Prediction:

Algorithm: RandomForest Classifier

Accuracy Score: 0.5

Description: Built a model to predict customer purchase behavior.

## Credit Card Default Prediction:

Algorithm: Logistic Regression

Accuracy: 95%

Description: Predicted the likelihood of credit card default with high accuracy.

## Common Tasks and Techniques

Throughout these projects, I consistently applied the following tasks and techniques:

Importing Libraries: Utilized essential Python libraries for data manipulation and machine learning.

Data Cleaning: Handled missing values and ensured data quality.

Feature Engineering: Applied encoding and other techniques to prepare features for modeling.

Model Selection: Chose appropriate models based on problem type (regression or classification).

## Evaluation Metrics:
For regression models: MSE (Mean Squared Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), and R2 score.

For classification models: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 score.

These projects provided me with valuable hands-on experience in applying data science and machine learning techniques to real-world problems.
